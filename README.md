Write and export as default a function that prints (console.log) numbers from begin to end. But:

If the number is a multiple of 3, print Fizz instead of the number
If the number is a multiple of 5, print Buzz instead of the number
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz instead of the number
Otherwise, print the number
The function accepts two parameters (begin and end). They define the range and are inclusive. If the range is empty (when begin > end), the function shouldn't print anything.

Example:
fizzBuzz(11, 20);

Output:
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
